# Right Profile
iotec Machine learning with profile based classification
profiles can be thought of as amalgamated data with a common trait, defining the data amalgamation

# Models
Thr right profile models are Logistic regression models that absorb data from profiles 
as collections of sparse hashes and then evaluate those hashes to determine the quality of the profile.

# Right Profile Jobs
The right person jobs are capable of creating large datasets, training over large datasets or defining models in paralell.
The jobs can define for each model a particular good set of profile ids, needed to identify good behaviour from normal.
The jobs can be used to create profile data from other data sources
The jobs can be used to train many models in parallel from the large profile datasets
since the spark jobs
